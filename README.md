*Author: Jae Choi*
Collaborated with Karlos Mangubat to get code working for lab 1 intro to Python
----

## Description
What the lab should do:

When run, the program should print an intro message and the menu for the restaurant

The restaurant’s menu should include appetizers, entrees, desserts, and beverages.

The program should prompt the user for an order

When a user enters an item, the program should print an acknowledgment of their input

The program should tell the user how to exit

The program’s content should match included sample exactly

Actually, there’s one tiny spot that should be different - see if you can spot it.

The > character represents user input line and should be printed out with a trailing space.
